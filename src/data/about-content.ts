      <p>When a billion people go hungry each day, how can we spend another dollar on war? Food Not Bombs is an all- volunteer movement that recovers food that would other wise be discarded, and shares free vegan and vegetarian meals with the hungry in over 1, 000 cities around the world as a way to protest war, poverty, and the destruction of the environment.We also provide food to the survivors of natural disasters and people participating in occupations, strikes, vigils, marches and other protests.</p>
      <p>Food Not Bombs is not a charity but seeks to end the crisis of corporate domination and exploitation through nonviolent direct action so no one is forced to stand in line to eat at a soup kitchen. Food Not Bombs has no formal leaders and strives to include everyone in its decision-making process. Each group recovers food that would otherwise be discarded; prepares fresh hot vegan and vegetarian meals that are share in public spaces like plazas, parks and sidewalks to everyone that passes by, without restriction; and distributes groceries, clothing and other supplies with the community.</p>
      <p>The first group was formed in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1980 by eight college-aged, anti-nuclear activists. In 1988, the San Francisco police started arresting our volunteers for the “crime” of making a political statement by sharing meals with the hungry making nearly 1,000 arrests by 1997. The police have also arrested our volunteers for feeding the hungry in a number of other cities in the United States including Middletown, Connecticut, Tampa and Orlando, Florida, Arcata and Los Angeles, California. Amnesty International declared that they would adopt any Food Not Bombs volunteers that is imprisoned as &ldquo;Prisoners of Conscience&rdquo; and will work for their unconditional release.</p>
      <p>Volunteers have shared food at anti-globalization protests in many cities including Seattle, Cancun, Miami, Gutenberg, and Toronto. Food Not Bombs organized the food relief effort for the survivors of Hurricane Katrina. Volunteers also fed the rescue workers in New York after 9/11; started animal rescue shelters in 24 cities in Slovakia; provided food for 100 days during the Orange Revolution in the Ukraine; fed Camp Casey in Crawford, Texas and striking auto workers in Korea; supported kitchens at hundreds of occupations including Occupy Wall Street, Occupy Oakland and Occupy DC.</p>
      <p>Food Not Bombs works in coalition with groups like Earth First!, The Leonard Peltier Defense Committee, Farm Animal Rights Movement, the IWW, and Anti Racist Action. Food Not Bombs activists started projects like Indymedia, Bikes Not Bombs, Homes Not Jails, Food Not Lawns, the Free Radio Movement, Really Really Free Markets and many other grass- roots projects. The movement has a 180 page book &rdquo;Hungry For Peace&ldquo; that provides the information one would need to start and maintaing a Food Not Bombs chapter. A copy is available by visiting <a href="https://www.foodnotbombs.net">www.foodnotbombs.net</a>. You can join Food Not Bombs in taking direct action towards creating a world free from domination, coercion and violence.</p>

    title: 'The Three Principles of Food Not Bombs',
    id: '3-principles',
    content: `
      <p><strong>Always vegan or vegetarian and free to everyone</strong><br />Our food is vegan or vegetarian and free to anyone without restriction, rich or poor, stoned or sober. First, the potential for problems with food spoilage are greatly reduced when dealing strictly with plant based foods. Second, we want our food to reflect our dedication to nonviolence and that included violence against all beings including animals. We only prepare food which is strictly from plant sources so people will always know and trust Food Not Bombs that our food is safe and nonviolent. At times, we do get donations of dairy and meat products which might and redirect it to soup kitchens that aren&apos;t vegetarian because we believe eating is more important than being politically pure; however, we NEVER cook with animal products ourselves and only share breads that might have dairy when it is not possible to know for sure.</p>
      <p><strong>Each chapter is independent and autonomous and makes decisions using the consensus process</strong><br />Each Food Not Bombs chapter is autonomous and uses a process of consensus to make decisions. There are no leaders, presidents or directors, and no headquarters. . Everyone in each chapter is encouraged to participate in the decision making including those who depend on Food Not Bombs for their meals. Your chapter may meet once a week or once a month but no one volunteer is empowered to tell the rest of the group how it is to operate and there is no headquarters to direct the activities of any chapter. The process of consensus is not voting or the use of &ldquo;Robert&apos;s Rules of Order&rdquo; where a majority determine the decisions. In consensus a decisions is not made until the proposal is one that everyone participating supports and can feel good giving their consent. There are a number of resources to help your chapter learn to use consensus on the web and you can also request support from volunteers who have been active in other Food Not Bombs groups.</p>
      <p><strong>Food Not Bombs is dedicated to nonviolence</strong><br />Food Not Bombs is not a charity but is dedicated to using nonviolent direct action to change society. Our volunteers not only provide meals to the hungry on the streets and at protests we also participate in planning and implementing campaigns of nonviolent direct action. Our volunteers helped organize and provided meals to activists at blockades, sit-ins, strikes, marches, tree sits and lock downs. Our actions can involve art, music, puppets, banners and many other creative strate- gies. Our volunteers have provided food to workers and their families while on strike and they have smuggled food into factory and office occupations. Food Not Bombs volunteers can help facilitate Nonviolence Trainings to prepare for campaigns of non-cooperation and nonviolent resistance. There is nothing passive about nonviolent direct action. Food is a right, not a privilege!</p>
